**CHESS GAME BACKEND**

This is a simple personal project to practice developing a simple application seperating the back end and front end.

**TODO**
- Write more unit tests
- Finish chess piece behaviour
- Set up a real build system (CMake or Bazel?)
- Decouple chess notation code (should be part of front end code) from backend  
- Better code commenting
- Create docstrings
